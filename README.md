# Blob Survival

A simple game, for a simple blob. Survive as long as you can!

## How to play:
Use the arrow or WASD keys to control the blob (ok it's a block really). Dodge the spawning and squirming blocks and stay away from the boundary to stay alive.
You get one point for each obstacle that's spawned when you die. What's your high score?

## About making the game:
I knew I wanted to experiment with drawing with HTML canvas for this project so I found a great tutorial on W3 Schools to base my exploration. This project felt like a 
spike moment for me, and although I struggled witih the beginning of this project, I feel much more cofident in my learning having modified things and made a slightly unique game. 
That said, my ambitions where for a lot more complexity in the end result, so feel like there is a lot more opportunity for my understanding to grow here.

## Future improvements:
- Sometime the obstacle pieces spawn underneath the blob, this is sub-optimal.
- Add music
- I would like to expand the game so that there is pac-man like element to it, so that one colour of obstacle will trigger a mode so you can clear/eat other obstacles.
